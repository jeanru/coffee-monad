coffee-monad
============

Monad implementations in Coffeescript for learning and practice

## What is Monad?
* In general, Monad is a design pattern
* Specifically, Monad is a data structure which implements unit (or return in Haskell)
and bind (or >>= in Haskell, flatMap in Scala)
and satisfies [Monad laws](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_laws)
* Monads were introduced in Haskell, but any language which supports higher order functions can implement Monads,
such as Javascript/Coffeescript
